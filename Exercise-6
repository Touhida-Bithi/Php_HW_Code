Loops are very useful in creating lists and tables. In this PHP exercise, you will use a loop to create a list of equations for squares.
Using a for loop, write a script that will send to the browser a list of squares for the numbers 1-12.Use the format,Â "1 * 1 = 1", and be sure to include code to print each formula on a different line.

Code:

<?php
echo "<table border "1" style='border-collapse: collapse'>";
	for ($row=1; $row <= 7; $row++) { 
		echo "<tr> \n";
		for ($colmn=1; $colmn <= 7; $colmn++) { 
		   $p = $colmn * $row;
		   echo "<td>$p</td> \n";
		   	}
	  	    echo "</tr>";
		}
		echo "</table>";
?>
