For this PHP exercise, write a script using the following variable:$around="around";
Single quotes and double quotes don't work the same way in PHP. Using single quotes (' ') and the concatenation operator, echo the following to the browser, using the variable you created:What goes around, comes around.
In this PHP exercise, you will use a conditional statement to determine what gets printed to the browser. Write a script that gets the current month and prints one of the following responses, depending on whether it's August or not:
It's August, so it's really hot.Not August, so at least not in the peak of the heat.
Hint: the function to get the current month is 'date('F', time())' for the month's full name.


Code:

<?php
	

	
	$around="around";

	echo 'What goes '. $around. ', comes '. $around;
  
$month=date('F', time());
if($month=='August'){
  echo "It's August, so it's really hot.\n";
}else{
  echo "Not August, so at least not in the peak of the heat.\n";
}

		 
	?>
